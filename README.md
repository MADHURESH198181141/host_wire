# App Session Analysis & Anomaly Detection Pipeline

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive data analysis pipeline designed to analyze mobile app session data. It uses a modular structure and a machine learning-powered approach to automatically detect a wide range of issues, including app crashes, bot-like behavior, user anomalies, and data quality problems.

The system is built to be both an analytical tool for generating deep insights and an automated monitoring system that can be used to maintain app health and security. It features a two-stage workflow: a **`train`** mode to build predictive models and a **`predict`** mode to generate reports using those models.

## 2. Key Features

- **Modular Analysis:** The codebase is separated into logical modules for different types of analysis (crashes, bots, user personas, etc.), making it easy to maintain and extend.
- **Machine Learning Powered:**
  - **Crash Prediction:** Uses a `RandomForestClassifier` to predict sessions at high risk of crashing.
  - **Bot Detection:** Employs an `IsolationForest` model for unsupervised anomaly detection to find subtle, non-rule-based bots.
  - **User Segmentation:** Leverages `KMeans` clustering to automatically group users into behavioral personas.
- **Model Persistence:** Trained machine learning models are saved as `.pkl` files, separating the time-consuming training process from the fast, daily prediction tasks.
- **Automated Reporting:** Generates a complete report in the console with clear data tables and statistical summaries.
- **Rich Visualizations:** Automatically produces and saves a suite of charts and graphs for quick, intuitive insights, including:
  - Crash summaries by app version.
  - Bot activity scatter plots.
  - Session behavior hotspots.
  - Data completeness heatmaps.

## 3. Project Structure

The project is organized into a clean, standard data science structure:
```
app_analyzer_project/
├── data/ # Stores input data files (e.g., .csv)
├── analysis/ # Core Python modules for each analysis task
├── reporting/ # Module for generating final reports
├── reports/ # Default output directory for charts and visuals
├── models/ # Stores the trained and saved .pkl model files
├── main.py # The main controller script to run the pipeline
├── requirements.txt # Lists all Python library dependencies
└── README.md # This file
```

## 4. Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

**Installation:**

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download and extract the project folder).

2.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal:
    ```shell
    cd path/to/your/app_analyzer_project
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python libraries** using the `requirements.txt` file. This command will install `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and other necessary packages.
    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 5. How to Use the Pipeline

The pipeline has two primary modes: `train` and `predict`.

### Step 1: Train the Models

You must first train the machine learning models on your dataset. This command will create and save all the necessary `.pkl` model files into the `/models` directory. You only need to do this once, or whenever you want to retrain on newer data.

```shell
python main.py train
```
You can optionally specify a path to your training data: `python main.py train data/your_training_data.csv`

### Step 2: Generate a Report

Once the models are trained, you can run the full analysis to generate a report. This is the most common command you will use.

To run the analysis on the default dataset:
```shell
python main.py
```
(This command defaults to 'predict' mode)

To run the analysis on a new, different dataset:
```shell
python main.py predict data/your_new_data.csv
```

### What Happens When You Run a Prediction?

The script will load the pre-trained .pkl models from the `/models` directory.
It will run the complete analysis pipeline.
A full text report with tables, summaries, and recommendations will be printed to your console.
A set of visual charts (.png files) will be saved to the `/reports` directory.

## 6. Future Improvements

This project is designed to be extensible. Future enhancements could include:
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Using Streamlit or Plotly Dash to create a web-based, interactive version of the reports.
- **Full Automation:** Integrating the pipeline with a workflow orchestrator like Apache Airflow to run analyses automatically on a schedule.
- **Real-Time Alerting:** Adding modules to send notifications to Slack or email when a critical anomaly is detected.
- **Database Integration:** Modifying the data loading module to pull data directly from a production database instead of a static CSV file.
